                        Thanos is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
                        He was created by writer-artist Jim Starlin, and made his first appearance in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (cover date February 1973). 
                        An Eternalâ€“Deviant warlord from the moon Titan, Thanos is regarded as one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.
                        He has clashed with many heroes including the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men.
                        While usually portrayed as an evil-bent villain, many stories have alternatively depicted Thanos as having a twisted moral compass and thinking of his actions as justified. The character's perhaps best-known role came in the 1991 storyline The Infinity Gauntlet, the culmination of several previous story arcs, which saw him successfully assembling the six Infinity Gems into a single gauntlet and using them to kill half of the universe's population, including many of its heroes, in an effort to earn the affection of Mistress Death, the living embodiment of death in the Marvel Universe. Although these events were later undone, the storyline has remained one of the most popular published by Marvel.

                        Debuting in the Bronze Age of comic books, the character has appeared in almost five decades of Marvel publications, as well as many media adaptations, including animated television series and video games. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the character was first played by Damion Poitier in the film The Avengers (2012) and then by Josh Brolin in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and the first season of the animated series What If...? (2021).
